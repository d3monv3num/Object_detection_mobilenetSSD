# Object_detection using mobilenetSSD
MobileNet SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector) is an object detection algorithm that combines the MobileNet architecture for feature extraction with a Single Shot MultiBox Detector for object detection. It is designed to be lightweight and efficient, making it suitable for real-time object detection tasks on mobile and embedded devices.

Here's an overview of the MobileNet SSD algorithm:

1. MobileNet Feature Extraction:
   - MobileNet is a lightweight convolutional neural network architecture designed specifically for mobile and embedded devices. It uses depth-wise separable convolutions to reduce the number of parameters and computational complexity while maintaining reasonable accuracy.
   - MobileNet is used as a feature extraction network in MobileNet SSD. It takes an input image and produces a set of feature maps at different scales.

2. Multi-scale Feature Maps:
   - MobileNet SSD generates feature maps at multiple scales by applying additional convolutional layers on top of the MobileNet feature maps. These additional layers capture features at different scales and resolutions.

3. Convolutional Predictor Layers:
   - MobileNet SSD uses convolutional predictor layers to generate bounding box predictions and class probabilities at each spatial location of the feature maps.
   - The predictor layers consist of a set of 3x3 convolutional filters with different numbers of output channels. These filters produce a set of feature maps that are used to predict the location and class of objects.

4. Default Anchor Boxes:
   - MobileNet SSD uses a set of predefined anchor boxes (also known as default boxes) at each spatial location of the feature maps.
   - Anchor boxes are responsible for capturing objects at different scales and aspect ratios. Each anchor box is associated with a set of class predictions and bounding box regressions.

5. Object Detection:
   - For each anchor box, MobileNet SSD predicts the offsets for the bounding box coordinates relative to the anchor box, as well as the class probabilities for each object class.
   - The predicted bounding box coordinates are adjusted based on the anchor box's position and dimensions, allowing for accurate localization of objects.
   - The class probabilities are computed using a softmax function and represent the likelihood of each anchor box containing a specific object class.

6. Non-maximum Suppression (NMS):
   - To eliminate redundant detections, MobileNet SSD applies a non-maximum suppression algorithm.
   - NMS removes overlapping bounding boxes with lower confidence scores, keeping only the most confident detection for each object.

7. Output:
   - The final output of MobileNet SSD is a set of bounding box predictions along with their corresponding class labels and confidence scores.
   - These predictions represent the detected objects in the input image.

MobileNet SSD is known for its efficiency and ability to achieve real-time object detection on resource-constrained devices. Its lightweight architecture and fast inference speed make it well-suited for various applications, including autonomous vehicles, robotics, and mobile applications.
